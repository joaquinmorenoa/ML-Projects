# Basic e-commerce

Suppose you are a Data Analyst in an e-commerce store and your task is to predict certain scenarios like:
  - Predicting bounce
  - weak spots in the website
  - make data driven decisions
  
The database contains the following:
  - is_mobile 	
  - n_products_viewed 	
  - visit_duration 	
  - is_returning_visitor 	
  - time_of_day 	
  - user_action
  
### Goals of the Project
