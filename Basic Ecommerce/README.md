Suppose you are a Data Analyst in an e-commerce store and your task is to predict certain scenarios like:
  - Predicting bounce
  - weak spots in the website
  - make data driven decisions
  
The database contains the following:
  - is_mobile 	
  - n_products_viewed 	
  - visit_duration 	
  - is_returning_visitor 	
  - time_of_day 	
  - user_action
  
We are going to predict the user action in this project i.e whether the user has bounced, added to cart, begins checkout or finished checkout.

We will be using Logistic Binary Classification.

The model successfully delivers with accuracy of 96%!
